            In May 2024, the National Insurance Commission (NIC) granted final
            approval for the merger of Sanlam and Allianz's Ghanaian
            subsidiaries. This consolidation resulted in the formation of
            SanlamAllianz, a joint venture operating across 27 African countries
            with a combined enterprise value of nearly $2 billion. The merger
            integrated Sanlam Life Insurance Ghana with Allianz Life Insurance
            Ghana, and Sanlam General Insurance Ghana with Allianz Insurance
            Ghana, aiming to enhance market presence and operational efficiency
            in Ghana's insurance sector.
